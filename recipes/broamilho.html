        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">An exciting, delicious, and beautiful bread originates from northern Portugal, where corn is a vital crop.</p>
        <p class="description">The cornflour is the magic that brings the yellow crumb and the beautiful crackled crust.</p>
        
        <h2 class="recipe-header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>300 gram wholegrain corn flour</li>
            <li>100 gram bread flour</li>
            <li>300 gram water</li>
            <li>8 gram fine salt</li>
            <li>100 gram sourdough starter</li>
            <li>Rice flour to sprinkle on the bread or use wheat flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Put the cornflour in a heat-proof bowl.</li>
            <li>Boil water in an electric boiler.</li>
            <li>Pour the water over the cornflour and stir until all the flour is hydrated. Let it cool to room temperature for about one hour.</li>
            <li>Add bread flour, salt, and sourdough starter, and knead the dough by hand until it forms a bread dough.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a boule and press it down slightly. Make sure the ball has a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>Spray the top of the dough with a water mister and sprinkle with rice flour. Use your hands to spread the flour evenly.</li>
            <li>Let the dough proof on the kitchen counter under a dishcloth. At least 3½ hours, but you can leave it until the following day.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 260°C/500°F with a dutch oven inside.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes with the loaf inside the dutch oven, then take the lid off the dutch oven and turn the oven down to 230°C/450°F.</li>
            <li>Keep baking until the bread is 99°C/210°F inside. It took about 25 minutes in my oven.</li>
            <li>Take the bread out of the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. It takes a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Enjoy a piece with butter and a great selection of cheese or some fantastic olives.</li>
