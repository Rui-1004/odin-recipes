        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Bifanas are traditional Portuguese sandwiches made with thin slices of pork that are marinated and simmered in a sauce of white wine, garlic, and paprika and served on soft rolls with plenty of mustard and piri-piri sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>680 g thinly sliced pork top round, cutlets, or thin-sliced boneless pork chops, trimmed of fat</li>
            <li>356 ml white wine</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves, broken in half</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Diamond kosher salt (or 1 1/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lard</li>
            <li>Papo secos or crusty rolls, to serve</li>
            <li>Mustard and piri-piri sauce, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Slip a slice of top round, a pork cutlet or pork chop into a zip-top bag or between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound it with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin until it's very thin but not torn. Ideally, you want it to be the thickness of deli meat, less than 1/8 of an inch (3mm) thick. Repeat with the rest of the pork.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the wine, garlic, bay leaves, vinegar, paprika, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the pork slices to a shallow pan and pour the marinade over top. Stir the pork in the liquid, making sure the slices are pretty much submerged. Refrigerate the pan for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring the meat several times.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot and add the lard. Fry the bifanas quickly until cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Add more lard if the pan threatens to dry out. Transfer the cooked bifanas to a plate.</li>
            <li>Discard the bay leaves and pour the reserved marinade into the skillet and scrape up any stuck-on bits. Let the mixture boil until reduced by about 1/3, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the bifanas back to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and simmer to warm them through.</li>
            <li>Slice the papo secos in half. Spoon some of the sauce over each half, pile with the pork, and, if desired, serve with the mustard and piri-piri sauce.</li>
        </ol>
